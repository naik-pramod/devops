### DevOps Concepts

#### DevOps
DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.

#### Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous integration (CI) is a practice in which frequent, isolated changes are immediately tested and reported on when they are added to a larger code base.
- It makes sure the code compiles without errors. 
- It makes sure all unit tests are passed, with the latest code changes and code coverage of unit tests being at a very high percentage.
- Validation for code security vulnerabilities and code quality is also performed.
- Artifacts are produced from CI systems and fed to release processes to drive frequent deployments.

##### Purpose
It helps to catch bugs early in the development cycle, which makes them less expensive to fix. 


#### Continuous Delivery (CD)
Continuous Delivery (CD) is a process by which code is built, tested, and deployed to one or more test and production environments.

#### Continuous Deployment
